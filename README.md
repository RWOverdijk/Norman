# Norman
Node.JS ORM.

## Another one..?
Yes, another one. However, with Norman we attempt to tackle some specific problems as listed below.

- Adapter support (both sequel and document based)
- Cross adapter associations
- Flexibility in building queries
- Repositories (as in, [the pattern](http://martinfowler.com/eaaCatalog/repository.html)).
- Entities
- Class based
